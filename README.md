### Hi there 👋, I am Mike de Groot

[![LinkedIn Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0A66C2?logo=linkedin&logoColor=fff&style=flat)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-de-groot-bb9546266/)

I am a Computer Science student at Avans University of Applied Sciences.

I'm a technology enthusiast who loves learning, tinkering, and building.  
Whether it's experimenting in my homelab, printing parts on my 3D printers, working on my car, or tackling electrical projects, I enjoy diving deep into technical challenges. I'm not afraid to learn a new skill — in fact, I research *everything* until I understand it fully.
